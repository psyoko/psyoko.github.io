        <p><em>* This post is ooold and some parts are broken; namely, the icons don’t work anymore because I don’t use Symbolsets anymore.</em></p>

<p>I love <a href="http://symbolset.com">Symbolset</a>, <a href="http://oak.is">Oak</a>’s collection of semantic fonts. I knew as I was rebuilding this site that I wanted to create a collection of tags for my blog posts, each associated with an icon. <a href="http://symbolset.com/icons/standard">SS Standard</a> was perfect for this, except for one thing: many of the keywords mapped to the icons I wanted to use didn’t always coincide with the tags I wanted to use them for.</p>

<p>If I published a post with photographs in it, I would want to use the tag “photos,” but Standard would map that word to a more general-looking <span class="ss-icon">photos</span>, which could be confusing because I plan on posting drawings and other visual content that isn’t photographic (sure enough, that icon is also mapped to “image” and “images”). I would prefer to use <span class="ss-icon">camera</span> — mapped “camera” — for photo-related posts. Unsurprisingly, I also have several tag words that aren’t mapped at all to Standard’s icons.</p>

<p>I didn’t want to compromise the language I used for tags for the following reasons:</p>

<ol>
  <li>It would feel semantically wrong.</li>
  <li>Remembering the right mapping keyword to use every time I wanted to publish a new post is something I don’t trust myself to do.</li>
  <li>If I do redesign this site (which is inevitable) and decide to use another semantic font that maps keywords differently, I would likely have to go through each post and modify the tags, which is a huge pain in the ass that I would much rather avoid.</li>
</ol>

<p>I didn’t want to “hack” the font themselves either — if I were to use them outside of the context of my blog tags (in the body of this post, for example), I would prefer to have the icons be mapped as originally intended.</p>

<p>My solution was to use empty elements with a <code class="highlighter-rouge">ss-icon</code> class, and inject another class, the tag slug, using Liquid. Here’s an example using a link to a tag URL:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;a href="" class="ss-icon "&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</code></p>
</blockquote>

<p>And then create a separate CSS snippet in my theme where any element with both the <code class="highlighter-rouge">ss-icon</code> class and the <code class="highlighter-rouge">[slug]</code> class will have the properly mapped keyword injected into the empty element:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/2013-10-18-symbolset-hacking.jpg" alt="A pie chart, because it looks like a pie, which is food! I know, it’s a bit of a stretch." /></p>

<p>This way, if I wanted to change the icon associated with any of my tags, I only need to open up and edit this one file. Another nice thing is that it’s a file associated only with the theme being used, and the hacking of Symbolset happens independently of any of the content living in Siteleaf.</p>

<p>A drawback of this is that if Symbolset isn’t supported, the original keyword would appear as text instead of the keyword I used for the tag, and the discrepancy could get confusing. But I suppose that would happen as long as the original keyword is mapped to that icon.</p>
