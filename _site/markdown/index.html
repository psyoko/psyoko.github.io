<p>In the reign of a certain Emperor, whose name is unknown to us, there was, among the Niogo and Kôyi <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> of the Imperial Court, one who, though she was not of high birth, enjoyed the full tide of Royal favor. Hence her superiors, each one of whom had always been thinking—”I shall be the <em>one</em>,” gazed upon her disdainfully with malignant eyes, and her equals and inferiors were more indignant still.</p>

<p>Such being the state of affairs, the anxiety which she had to endure was great and constant, and this was probably the reason why her health was at last so much affected, that she was often compelled to absent herself from Court, and to retire to the residence of her mother.</p>

<p>Her father, who was a Dainagon<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup>, was dead; but her mother, being a woman of good sense, gave her every possible guidance in the due performance of Court ceremony, so that in this respect she seemed but little different from those whose fathers and mothers were still alive to bring them before public notice, yet, nevertheless, her friendliness made her oftentimes feel very diffident from the want of any patron of influence.</p>

  <li>In Japan there is a great number of “mushi” or insects, which sing in herbage grass, especially in the evenings of Autumn. They are constantly alluded to in poetry.</li>
  <li>In Japanese poetry, persons connected with the Court, are spoken of as “the people above the clouds.”</li>
  <li>A famous Chinese poem, by Hakrak-ten. The heroine of the poem was Yô-ki-hi, to whom we have made reference before. The story is, that after death she became a fairy, and the Emperor sent a magician to find her. The works of the poet Peh-lo-tien, as it is pronounced by modern Chinese, were the only poems in vogue at that time. Hence, perhaps, the reason of its being frequently quoted.</li>
  <li>There were two divisions of the Imperial guard, right and left.</li>
  <li>The general name for a species of musical instrument resembling the zither, but longer.</li>
</ol>
