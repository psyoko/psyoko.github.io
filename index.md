## Hay! My name is Yoko.

I live in Brooklyn and work at [Etsy](https://etsy.com) as a product designer. I also co-host a podcast called [So Where Are You From?](https://swayfpodcast.com). When I’m not doing either of those things, I’m probably dancing, [exploring]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2016-06-30-your-nyc-guide.md %}), or internetting. I like pandas.

## Around the webs

If you’d like to get in touch, [shoot me an email](mailto:ysohama+yokois@gmail.com)! I don’t really tweet anymore, but I have [a bot](https://twitter.com/psyoko_ebooks) that does a pretty good job of it, if that interests you.

As told by Kevin Huynh

Yoko
Is a very special person
One time she worked at a place
Blah blah blah
Ok let’s get real

My name is Yoko
I have friends, three to be exact
One of them is a feral cat in a parking lot near my home
I like hangin’, dancin’, and sometimes being alone (that’s important)

If I were stranded on a desert island and could only have three cuisines of food, I would have Japanese food, Japanese food, and Japanese food. 
Just kidding, it’s Japanese, Vietnamese, and Italian.

I host a podcast—whatever.
I like pandas—whatever.

Ten years from now, you’re gonna say you’re lucky to know me.

YOKO OUT
