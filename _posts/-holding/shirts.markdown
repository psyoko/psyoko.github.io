Guys! Guys!

For a while I’d been thinking about making dope custom shirts for dance class and I finally got my act together, finished a design that I had started months ago, opened a store at [Society6](http://society6.com/psyoko?promo=dc8af7) and threw that ish up. 

And then I bought one. And it arrived today!

Because that’s all I really wanted. If you like it too and you buy one, bonus! (Plus I get a cut! Super bonus.)

Right now I just have two designs ([this one](http://society6.com/psyoko/Eligible-Bachelor_T-shirt?promo=dc8af7#11=49&4=75) and a [Tolkien quote](http://society6.com/psyoko/Not-all-those-who-wander-52L_T-shirt?promo=dc8af7#11=50&4=76) I originally made for [Rusty](http://rusty.am)), and Society6 automatically makes prints and other things when you post artwork. If you’re into it, buy one! And if you’re really into it, you should set up an account. Hellll yeah.
