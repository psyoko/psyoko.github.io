Kevin and I are currently in DC for the weekend. We are celebrating our epic romantic matchup, which began one year ago on Super Bowl Sunday. 

One of my resolutions this year is to get more familiar with sports, and there is not a better opportunity for me to start getting invested than when bragging rights and food are at stake. The following are our predictions for the Super Bowl (to be updated as the results come in).
