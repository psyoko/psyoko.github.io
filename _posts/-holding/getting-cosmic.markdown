I had some lettering to go along with this image, but I could not for the life of me get it to look right. In the spirit of &ldquo;Fuck It, Ship It,&rdquo; I present to you just the photo. The doodle that was to become the text for this will eventually present itself in the following weeks.

Hurricane Sandy has halted my regular working hours and I suddenly have a lot of brain space to think about things that I normally would ignore because I wouldn&rsquo;t think there was any time for it. Now that I&rsquo;ve been given this opportunity to step back, I think I see what [Aaron Draplin](http://draplin.com) meant when he emphasized the need to &ldquo;get cosmic&rdquo; at his [Brooklyn Beta](http://brooklynbeta.org) talk two weeks ago (feels like ages ago).
