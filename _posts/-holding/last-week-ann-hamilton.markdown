Went to Ann Hamilton’s [Event of a Thread](http://www.armoryonpark.org/programs_events/detail/ann_hamilton) installation at the Park Avenue Armory last week.

I didn’t get any photos of the swings, but to me they were the most magical part. With the swing seats at human-level but suspended 80 feet in the air, there is a short moment where I felt like I was gliding just above the ground as opposed to swinging on a curve. I felt like I was flying!
