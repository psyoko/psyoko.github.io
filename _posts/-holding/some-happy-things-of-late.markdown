Today was a good day. I finally got around to picking up my now-too-late second Halloween costume (the first being [this](http://instagram.com/p/RToSzeQbML/)). If you’re interested in getting one, [here you go](http://fredflare.com/APPAREL-coats-and-jackets/Domo-Costume). Of course, I went to work and wore it. It was a hit! Success! Brown fuzzy finger-less high-fives all around.

Today was also a good day partly because of [this playlist](http://www.rdio.com/people/psyoko/playlists/582469/LA-DIEEES/) that I started last week — consisting of hip-hop, R&B, and _some_ pop, only by female artists:

I opened the list for collaboration, and I got an _amazing_ collection of songs. I haven’t stopped listening to it. I am obsessed. And folks keep adding to it! I am most tickled that my collaborators on this ladies-only list are all gentlemen. A hundred eProps each to [Rusty](http://rusty.am), [Dave](http://iamdavedawson.com), [Larry](http://larryfox.us), [Sawyer](http://sawyerhollenshead.com/), and [Ken](http://siik.org). 

Thanksgiving is this week! I should feel grateful that days like today are fairly normal for me.
