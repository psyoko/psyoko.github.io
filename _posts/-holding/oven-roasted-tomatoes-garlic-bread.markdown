My parents went tomato picking in Long Island or something during the summer, and brought back a buttload of tomatoes. Like a heaping crateful each time. They went twice. Anyway, there was a lot left over so I guess my mom made oven-dried tomatoes. And then I made oven-dried tomato garlic bread.

* Preheated oven to 275º
* Peeled and minced the cloves of garlic, cut down the oven-dried tomatoes, and cooked in butter (2 tbsp or so) over low heat for 10–15 minutes — probably the longer, the better. 
* Drizzle the garlic + tomato stuff onto baguette. I used one of those half/third-size baguettes from Whole Foods.
* Wrapped in foil and then threw into oven.
* Unwrapped foil after 25 minutes or so, then broiled/toasted for like 3 minutes! Done.

All of these numbers are retrospective guesstimates. Whatever!

Plus some kale salad, bacon, and Asian pears = Sunday morning.
