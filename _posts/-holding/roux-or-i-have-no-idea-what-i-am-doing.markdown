![Pasta with stuff in it](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/28312/Yoko.is%20Assets/Images/2012-1004-roux.jpg)

I only had a vague idea of what went into a roux when I was making this, and I didn't even really know if roux was appropriate for pasta (after making this, I have decided that it is, I think). 

I wrongly assumed that there was flour in the apartment, but I managed to find some potato starch. And then I added a half-stick of butter on a pan and stirred until science! and then I added some milk, and then more science happened. Had some previously fried onions and mushrooms so I added that, and then this egg noodle stuff that was probably too old.

Not so bad, not so bad at all. Even better with hot sauce!

I should probably not sound so self-deprecating when I talk about food I make.
