![Went to Alcatraz, y’all!](/uploads/old-alcatraz-feet.jpg)

I recently returned from an epic 2-week vacation, in which I walked all over San Francisco and then met up with Kevin for [a wedding](http://craigandkaryn.com) in Seattle. I had just watched [The Rock](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117500/), Kevin’s favorite action movie of all time, so I was pumped to visit Alcatraz while I was in SF and was doubly excited to learn that Ai Weiwei had just opened an on-site exhibit there.

Aside from the fantastic immersive audio tour, I was struck by how beautiful the light was inside the buildings at Alcatraz. Maybe I went at the perfect time on the perfect day, but the light that was coming in through the latticed windows was just awesome.

I would even venture to say that I was most impressed by the lighting of the place rather than any of the Ai Weiwei installations themselves.

If you’re thinking of going to the Bay anytime soon, here’s a [comprehensive map](https://www.mapbox.com/editor/?id=psyoko.jnk51ifd#app) of every place I went to, plus some walking routes (that I don’t necessarily recommend):
