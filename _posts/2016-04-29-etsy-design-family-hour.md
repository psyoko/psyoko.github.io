## Introductions

Hello! Thank you Kyle and the Etsy Design Team for having me. 
Excited to be here + do this talk bc I felt like I learned about myself in the process of making it. We’ll go on this journey together.

My name is Yoko, I’m currently a designer at Squarespace.

My main responsibility at Squarespace is creating new variants of our website templates, as well as templates for our Commerce platform and layouts for our single-page product, Cover Pages. 

Basically, I create personas and build out websites for them in a way that a customer can see them and immediately relate to them. It’s an interesting combination of marketing, communication, and product design.
