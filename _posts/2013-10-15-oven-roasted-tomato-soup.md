**![Why yes, indeed I bought alphabet pasta!](/assets/2013-10-20-tomato-soup-1.jpg)** 

I recently bought a [stick blender](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00ARQVM5O/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00ARQVM5O&linkCode=as2&tag=yokois-20) to welcome soup season. I had bought this alphabet pasta from Whole Foods months ago, and I didn’t have any use for it ... until today.

Recipe from [Smitten Kitchen](http://smittenkitchen.com/blog/2011/09/roasted-tomato-soup-with-broiled-cheddar/). I was especially excited to make this soup, because I had been collecting vegetable scraps from previous cooking sessions and saving them in the freezer. About one month’s worth of diligent cooking and scrap-saving filled a gallon freezer bag, which in turn yielded maybe about two quarts of stock.

So super excited to make more soup! Yeeee.
