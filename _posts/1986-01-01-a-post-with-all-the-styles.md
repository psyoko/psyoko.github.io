# The Week in Good News

Sometimes it seems as if we’re living under a constant barrage of heavy news. But it isn’t all bad out there. This feature is meant to send you into the weekend with a smile, or at least a lighter heart. 

## A “forest masterpiece” in Yosemite National Park is back on display.

A collection of around 500 mature giant sequoias, some of the oldest living things in the world, is open to visitors again after the largest restoration project in Yosemite’s history.

The project, a $40 million renovation, addressed a traffic problem that brought exhaust and noise to the Mariposa Grove. Partly financed with a $20 million gift from the Yosemite Conservancy, the project involved ripping up pavement and replacing it with walking paths of packed dirt and resin.

“This project was all about the trees,” Sue Beatty, an ecologist who helped lead the project, said. “We wanted to improve their survivability in the time of a changing climate.”

## New Zealand’s prime minister became the first world leader in almost three decades to give birth while in office.

“Welcome to our village wee one,” Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern posted on Instagram.

The last world leader to deliver a baby while in office was Benazir Bhutto of Pakistan, who had her second child, a daughter, in 1990. That daughter, Bakhtawar Bhutto Zardari, congratulated Ms. Ardern on Twitter on Thursday.

Ms. Ardern will take six weeks of leave before returning to work. She announced her pregnancy three months after a surprise election victory, and the news prompted an international reckoning about the rarity of pregnant women in the corridors of power.
