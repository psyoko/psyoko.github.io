# README file for yoko.is

Wow everyone can read this and that’s cool ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

### Todos lol
- Better treatments for images
- Better typescale for post content
- Add “ongoing” section to Archive page, also maybe a “featured” tag too

### Questions
- Is there a way to list all of the scoped variables on a given page?
- `id`s instead of `class`es for site layout stuff?
