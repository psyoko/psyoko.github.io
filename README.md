# README file for yoko.is

Wow everyone can read this and that’s cool ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

### Todos lol
- Better treatments for images
- Better typescale for post content
- Badge styles
- You actually don’t have any content in your posts

### Questions
- Is there a way to list all of the scoped variables on a given page?
- `id`s instead of `class`es for site layout stuff?
