As told by Kevin Huynh

Yoko
Is a very special person
One time she worked at a place
Blah blah blah
Ok let’s get real

My name is Yoko
I have friends, three to be exact
One of them is a feral cat in a parking lot near my home
I like hangin’, dancin’, and sometimes being alone (that’s important)

If I were stranded on a desert island and could only have three cuisines of food, I would have Japanese food, Japanese food, and Japanese food. 
Just kidding, it’s Japanese, Vietnamese, and Italian.

I host a podcast—whatever.
I like pandas—whatever.

Ten years from now, you’re gonna say you’re lucky to know me.

YOKO OUT
