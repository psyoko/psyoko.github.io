Hay! My name is Yoko Sakao Ohama. I was born and raised in NYC, sunned and schooled in Los Angeles, and now I live in Brooklyn and work at Etsy.

Along with my friend [Kate](https://katematsumoto.com), I co-host a podcast called [So Where Are You From?](https://swayfpodcast.com), where we highlight the multifaceted and shared experiences of being Asian in the US and beyond. Mostly we just talk smack and chat with cool guests.

My spare time is spent enjoying food, taking dance class, [exploring the city](https://drive.google.com/open?id=16FX4JH13RlT1lB_o1_keDbCWHG0&usp=sharing), and [internetting](https://twitter.com/yokogoesplorin). I’ve become the person to whom people will send panda things because they think I will like them. [And I do.](https://psyoko.dropmark.com/210220)
