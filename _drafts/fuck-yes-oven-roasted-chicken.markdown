![You can’t even tell those veggies are cold because I don’t have a microwave. Also damn, I should get a better camera than my iPhone 4.](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/28312/Yoko.is%20Assets/Images/2013-0424-fuck-yes-chicken.jpg)

I’m not even going to pretend I came up with this recipe. I will say that I actually yelled “Fuck yes!” when I had my first bite of this. Alone, in my apartment, while reading Reddit. 

[Here’s the original recipe from The Kitchn](http://www.thekitchn.com/recipe-pan-roasted-chicken-thighs-warm-bread-salad-169385). I just added some dried-up fresh thyme that the very nice grocer down the street gave me for free when I said “thank you” in Korean. I’ve actually avoided the place because I don’t want to go back without having learned more words. Is that weird? Whatever. 

Bonus: panfried chicken drippings GRAVY!!!  
Double bonus: I have lots of bones and I will be making chicken stock out of them. 

Yeah okay cool. Lunch tomorrow is going to be *awesome*.
