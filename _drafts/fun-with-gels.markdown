Earlier with week, during our regular [Tattly](http://tattly.com) shoots, I was able to play around with [Julia's](http://juliarobbs.com) photo gels. I'm far from a [pro](http://everypixel.tumblr.com) and just using my iPhone (not easy, by the way), but they were super fun! It's like using a Photoshop filter â€¦ in real life!
