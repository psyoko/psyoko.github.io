![a rather unappetizing photo of corn chowder](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/28312/Yoko.is%20Assets/Images/2012-0920-corn-chowder.jpg)

Something I discovered not that long ago was that if you just boil the crap out of a bunch of de-kernel'd ears of corn, the resulting corn-water is actually quite broth-y.

In this case I added some milk and about 3 earsworth of the 5 ears of corn I shucked (boiled all the cobs; the rest of the kernels went into a curry). Then some sauteed onions and cherry tomatoes and then salt, pepper, paprika. This chowder was DECENT. I know that in the photo (and in real life) it kind of resembles vomit. If you could get past that you would enjoy this.
