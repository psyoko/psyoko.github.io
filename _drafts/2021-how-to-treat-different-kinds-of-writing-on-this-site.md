title: How to treat different kinds of writing on this site

## Different kinds of writing

I want to encourage in myself different kinds of writing:

1. Sometimes I’ve found that the act of writing itself is beneficial for me. I don’t think I necessarily need to see it again, and it’s likely that I don’t intended for anyone else to see it at all. I’ve done this kind of writing in physical and digital journals; I think this kind of writing should remain hidden.

2. Sometimes I’ve found that reading things I’ve written in the past is beneficial, to regain the perspective I’ve had at the time, or to see how much (or maybe how little) I’ve changed since that time of writing. I think this sort of writing, when I’m writing it I’m not sure if I’ll get value out of looking back on it. 

3. Sometimes I write because I want to remember something. Maybe it’s a feeling, or something notable. I still think the primary audience for this sort of writing is myself. I think I used to do this sort of writing a lot, but social media has really changed the dynamic that I sort of started angling the writing to be written for other people to read. I want to get better at the original approach of writing for myself. I don’t think this necessarily needs to be public either, but I don’t really mind if other people read it; maybe that means it gets a different treatment from this last bit:

4. Sometimes I write because I want to share it. I think this stuff should be the most visible and easy to find on my site.
